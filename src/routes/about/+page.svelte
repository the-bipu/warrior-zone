      This is a <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit">SvelteKit</a> app. I created
      it for people who want to share their terrible experiences—whether about their
      day or any situation. Initially, I made this app for myself when I was having
      a horrible day and regretted being too shy to express my feelings. Then, I
      realized I wasn't the only one who has faced such moments, so I decided to
      make it public. Now, anyone can share their experiences here, and the best
      part is that it's completely anonymous—no one is watching you.
